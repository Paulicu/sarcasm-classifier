        Detecting sarcasm in text is a complex challenge that has significant implications for natural language processing. This paper investigates various machine learning and deep 
        learning approaches to sarcasm detection, focusing on models with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bag-of-Words (BoW) representations, as well as 
        Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks utilizing GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings. My results demonstrate that TF-IDF-based models achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and 
        misclassification rates, while LSTM models exhibit promising performance, with Word2Vec outperforming GloVe embeddings. The results highlight the importance of model selection and 
        feature representation in sarcasm detection models. I wish for this to provide baseline benchmarks for future research aimed at improving the computational understanding of sarcastic expressions.
